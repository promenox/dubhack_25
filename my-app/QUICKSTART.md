# FocusAI Quick Start Guide 🚀

## First Time Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Set Your Goal 🎯

When you first open FocusAI, you'll see a prompt to set your focus goal.

**Example goals:**

-   "Complete project presentation"
-   "Study for algorithms exam"
-   "Write blog post about React"
-   "Design new landing page"

Choose a category that matches your work:

-   💼 **Work** - Professional tasks
-   📚 **Study** - Learning and courses
-   🎨 **Creative** - Design, writing, art
-   🎯 **Other** - Everything else

### Step 2: Optional - Add AI Enhancement 🤖

For smarter insights, add your OpenAI API key:

1. Click the ⚙️ settings button (bottom-right)
2. Get an API key from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Paste it in the settings
4. Click "Save API Key"

**Don't have an API key?** No problem! FocusAI works great with built-in rule-based scoring.

### Step 3: Start Working! 💪

That's it! Just minimize FocusAI and get to work. The app tracks your activity automatically.

## Understanding Your Dashboard

### 🌱 Garden (Top Left)

Your digital plant that grows with your focus:

-   Starts as **Soil** 🟤
-   Grows to **Flourishing Garden** 🌺✨
-   Updates every ~10 minutes
-   Never completely dies (positive reinforcement!)

### 🎯 Focus Score (Top Right)

Two scores that matter:

**Right Now** (Instantaneous)

-   Your current 3-minute window
-   Updates every 3 minutes
-   Shows if you're rising 📈, falling 📉, or stable ➡️

**Overall Progress** (Cumulative)

-   Your sustained focus over time
-   Weighted average of recent activity
-   More stable, less reactive

### 💭 AI Insights (Bottom Right)

Every 30 minutes you get:

-   Feedback on your focus patterns
-   Top activities tracked
-   Actionable suggestions

## How Scoring Works

### You Get Points For:

✅ Consistent keyboard activity (35%)
✅ Staying in one app (40%)
✅ Being active vs. idle (25%)

### Score Ranges:

-   **75-100**: Excellent focus 🔥
-   **50-74**: Good, minor distractions ✅
-   **0-49**: Scattered attention 📉

### AI Multiplier (0.5x - 1.5x):

The AI understands context:

-   YouTube tutorial about coding? ✅ **Boosted**
-   Switching between LeetCode and games? ❌ **Reduced**
-   Reading docs related to your goal? ✅ **Boosted**

## Tips for Best Results

### 🎯 Set Clear Goals

Be specific! "Build user authentication" is better than "Code stuff"

### 💼 Close Distractions

Before starting, close:

-   Social media apps
-   Chat apps (unless needed)
-   Games and entertainment

### ⏰ Work in Blocks

-   3-minute windows add up fast
-   Try 25-minute focus blocks (Pomodoro)
-   Take breaks to avoid burnout

### 📊 Check Your Summaries

Every 30 minutes, review AI insights:

-   What patterns emerged?
-   Which apps were most used?
-   Are you aligned with your goal?

### 🌱 Watch Your Garden Grow

It's a visual reminder of your consistency:

-   Daily focus = steady growth
-   Sporadic work = slow progress
-   The garden never fully dies!

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Coming Soon)

-   `Ctrl/Cmd + P` - Pause/Resume tracking
-   `Ctrl/Cmd + G` - Set new goal
-   `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` - Open settings

## Understanding the Data

### What's Tracked:

✅ Active application name
✅ Window title
✅ Number of keystrokes
✅ Idle time
✅ App switches

### What's NOT Tracked:

❌ Actual keystrokes or content
❌ Screenshots
❌ Browser history details
❌ File contents

### Where's My Data?

-   Stored locally in your browser's localStorage
-   Never sent to external servers (except OpenAI for AI features)
-   Cleared when you uninstall the app

## Common Questions

### Q: Why is my score low even though I'm working?

A: Check if:

-   You're switching apps frequently
-   You're in "passive viewing" mode (watching videos)
-   You've been idle
-   Your activity doesn't match your goal keywords

### Q: How long until I see my first summary?

A: 30 minutes of tracked activity

### Q: Can I use this for multiple projects?

A: Yes! Just change your goal when you switch tasks

### Q: Does it work offline?

A: Yes! Only AI features require internet. Rule-based scoring works offline.

### Q: Will this drain my battery?

A: No. FocusAI is very lightweight and only checks activity every 5 seconds.

## Advanced Tips

### Optimize Your Workflow

1. **Single-tasking**: Keep one main app open
2. **Batch similar tasks**: Group emails, coding, research
3. **Regular breaks**: Stand up every 25-30 minutes

### Interpret Your Patterns

-   **High switching**: Maybe you need better planning
-   **Low keystrokes + high focus**: Good for reading/design
-   **High activity + high switches**: Could be research-heavy work

### Set Stretch Goals

As your garden grows:

-   Aim for higher average scores
-   Reduce app switching count
-   Increase focused time blocks

## Troubleshooting

### Scores seem stuck at 0?

-   Make sure you're interacting with your computer (keystrokes/mouse)
-   Wait for the first 3-minute window to complete
-   Check that tracking is enabled (green dot in header)

### Garden not growing?

-   Garden updates every ~10 minutes
-   You need consistent good scores (50+)
-   Check your cumulative score - that drives growth

### AI summaries are generic?

-   Add more context to your goal
-   Include relevant keywords
-   Make sure your OpenAI API key is valid

## Getting Help

Found a bug or have a suggestion?

-   Check the main README.md for architecture details
-   Look at browser console for error messages
-   Verify your Node and npm versions are up to date

## Next Steps

Now that you understand FocusAI:

1. ✅ Set a meaningful goal
2. ✅ Start your first focus session
3. ✅ Check back after 3 minutes to see your first score
4. ✅ Watch your garden grow over time!

**Happy focusing! 🎯🌱**
